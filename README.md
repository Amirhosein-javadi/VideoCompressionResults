# Video Compression and Pixel Tracking Results

This repository contains results from our video compression and pixel tracking experiments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our compression algorithm while maintaining visual quality, along with pixel tracking capabilities.

## Video Compression Results

We present side-by-side comparisons of original and compressed videos for three high-resolution sequences:

1. **Beauty**

2. **Bosphorus**

3. **YachtRide**

Each comparison video shows the original footage on the left and our compressed version on the right.

### Compression Rate Comparison

The following table shows the average compression rates in bits per pixel (bpp) for different methods:

| Method | Average bpp |
|--------|-------------|
| Our Method | 0.008 |
| DCVC | 0.0306 |

## Enhanced Pixel Tracking Results

We also present results from our pixel tracking algorithm, demonstrated on the HoneyBee sequence:

- **HoneyBee_all_tracking_pred_track.mp4**
  - Shows the tracking of selected pixels throughout the video sequence

# Video Compression and Enhanced Pixel Tracking Results

This repository contains results from our video compression and enhanced pixel tracking experiments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our compression algorithm while maintaining visual quality, along with pixel tracking capabilities.

## Video Compression Results

We present side-by-side comparisons of original and compressed videos for three high-resolution sequences:

1. **Beauty**

2. **Bosphorus**

3. **YachtRide**

Each comparison video shows the original footage on the left and our compressed version on the right.

## Enhanced Pixel Tracking Results

We also present results from our enhanced pixel tracking algorithm, demonstrated on the HoneyBee sequence:

- **HoneyBee_all_tracking_pred_track.mp4**
  - Shows the tracking of selected pixels throughout the video sequence
  - Demonstrates the algorithm's ability to:
    - Track points across frames with high accuracy
    - Handle complex motion patterns
    - Maintain tracking consistency in challenging scenarios
